# Bill Splitter
I made this application with the intention of being able to split grocery bills with my roommates easier. I still use it to this day. I leveraged my newly discovered love for computer science to make something practical for myself. This was after one introductory class in Python during my time at UCF. Using the Python program as a starting point, I have now used the same logic to apply it onto a webpage.
